 *          see: compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/GovernorAlpha.sol
 *          This decentralized governance system allows users to propose and vote on changes to the protocol.
 *          The contract is responsible for:
 *          - Proposal: A new proposal is made to introduce a change.
 *          - Voting: Users can vote on the proposal, either in favor or against it.
 *          - Quorum: A minimum number of votes (quorum) must be reached for the proposal to pass.
 *          - Execution: Once a proposal passes, it is executed and takes effect on the protocol.
