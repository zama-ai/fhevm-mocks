## About

### What is fhevm?

**fhevm** is a technology that enables confidential smart contracts on the EVM using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

Thanks to a breakthrough in homomorphic encryption, fhevm makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on
encrypted data, guaranteeing both confidentiality and composability with:

- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to
  anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn't impact existing
  dApps. <br></br>
