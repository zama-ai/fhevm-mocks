/**
 * @title CleartextHCULimit
 * @notice The HCU limit of a cleartext stack, carrying the markers that identify one.
 * @dev Behaviourally identical to `HCULimit`: it adds one constant and overrides nothing. A real
 *      deployment has neither selector, so a consumer can probe it to tell a cleartext stack from a production
 *      deployment. The generation marker lives on `CleartextACL` alone, the one address every consumer
 *      already holds; `getVersion()` here still reports the base contract.
 *
 *      Constants rather than storage: these run behind proxies, where an initialized state variable is
 *      only ever written to the implementation's own storage and reads back as `false` or zero through
 *      the proxy.
