/**
 * @title CleartextForgeArithmetic
 *
 * @notice The forge-only arithmetic: forge's randomness, and an answer for handles the store never saw.
 *
 * @dev WHY UNKNOWN HANDLES ARE THIS CONTRACT'S PROBLEM. On a stack that minted everything it is asked
 *      about, every operand is in the store and a miss is a bug. On a FORK it is the normal case: the
 *      chain is full of handles created before the cleartext layer existed, and their cleartexts are
 *      nowhere. Something has to decide what those read as, and it cannot be the SDK -- when a dApp calls
 *      `fheAdd(oldHandle, x)` the operand is read HERE, inside the stack, with no test code in the frame.
 *
 * @dev THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN, and each step exists because the one below it is not enough:
 *        1. A VALUE IN THE STORE WINS, always. A handle seeded by a test, or minted by this stack, is a
 *           fact -- a policy that could override it would make a seeded fuzz input unreliable.
 *        2. A PER-TYPE DEFAULT, because "every unknown value is 1" is rarely what a test means. An
 *           `eaddress` wants an address and an `ebool` wants a bit, and one global number gives neither.
 *        3. DERIVED FROM THE HANDLE, `keccak256(handle)` truncated to the type. Deterministic, so a run
 *           repeats; unrelated to the handle's layout, so it does not collide the way reading the handle's
 *           own bytes would -- those carry the chain id, type and version, identical across handles.
 *        4. OTHERWISE IT REVERTS, naming the handle and its type. A test that meant to seed and forgot
 *           gets told so, rather than a silent zero that decrypts to a plausible-looking answer.
