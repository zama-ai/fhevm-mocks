// VERBATIM EXTRACT from @fhevm/solidity 0.13.3, lib/Impl.sol. DO NOT EDIT — everything between the two
// markers below is copied byte for byte, so that it can be regenerated from upstream rather than
// maintained here. The extraction is two slices, each anchored on an exact line:
//
//   struct  from "/**\n * @title   CoprocessorConfig" through the struct's closing brace
//   library from the "/// keccak256(abi.encode(...)" comment through the end of `setCoprocessor`
//
// v14 note: 0.13.3 is the newest @fhevm/solidity on npm. Checked against the fhevm repository at v0.14.1
// (library-solidity/lib/Impl.sol): the struct, the slot and both functions are byte-identical. That
// revision inserts two `fheMulDiv` scalar-byte constants between the slot and the functions; they are
// unrelated to the config and deliberately not carried here.
//
// ## Why a copy, and why byte-exact
//
// `FHE` is an internal library: its code runs in the CALLER's context, and every call reads the three
// addresses out of `COPROCESSOR_CONFIG_LOCATION` in the caller's own storage. A forge test that wants to
// call `FHE.*` itself therefore has to write that slot, and a dApp compiled against a different network's
// config has to be retargeted at it. One digit wrong in the slot and the reads land somewhere harmless
// looking and entirely wrong, so the constant and the struct layout are not restated here — they are
// lifted, unchanged, from the library that defines them.
//
// This package deliberately does not depend on `@fhevm/solidity`, which is the other half of the reason:
// a consumer's tests must work whatever version of that library they compile against, and a copy pinned
// to a known version is checkable in a way a peer dependency is not.
//
// ## The struct is a distinct type
//
// `CoprocessorConfig` below has the same name and the same layout as the upstream one, but it is a
// DIFFERENT Solidity type. A file that imports both this and `@fhevm/solidity/lib/Impl.sol` must alias
// one of them. Layout is what matters — the storage written is identical either way.
